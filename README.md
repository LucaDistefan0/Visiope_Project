Object Recognition

Object detection is widely used for face detection, vehicle detection, pedestrian counting, web images, security systems and self-driving cars. In this project, we’ll work in outdoor environment for self-driving future purpose. We’ll use object detection-algorithms and methods based on deep learning. To achieve our goal we’ll use RNN.

We want to detect each and every object in image by the area object in an highlighted rectangular boxes, identify each and every object and assign its tag them.

The dataset that will are considering is TAO (Tracking Any Object Dataset). TAO is a federated dataset for Tracking Any Object, containing 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. A bottom-up approach was used for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. The dataset was annotated by labelling tracks for objects that move at any point in the video, and giving names to them post factum.
